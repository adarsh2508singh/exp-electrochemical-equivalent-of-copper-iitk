  <li>First user will note the value  weight of copper electrode  dip it into the solution<br> </li>
<li>After diping user will switch on the circuit and start the timer and take reading at particular time of instant. <br></li>
<li>Now user will dry the electrode and try to find mass deposited on copper electrode. <br></li>
</ol>
<h3> Calculation </h3>



A. Mass of copper deposited <br>
Initial mass of the cathode, W1 = 27.6 gm<br>
Final mass of the cathode, W2 = 28.6 gm<br>
Mass of copper deposited, W = (W2 â€“ W1) = (28.6 - 27.6) = 1 gm<br>
B. Data for finding equivalent weight of copper<br>
Time for required current pass, t = 1800 sec<br>
Mean current, I = 2.197 amp<br>
